#Notes
This is my first GIT-based project. It's also the first REAL javascript development I've done in years.

I am going to try to cover the basics of what I want to see happen with this project in case the original repository that I forked from isn't interested in including my commits as well as in case anyone interested in the direction I envision wants to work on this as well. What I am wanting is actually fairly simple in terms of describing. I'm QUITE pleased that someone else had started this as I was still in the early stages of finishing touches on an OAuth process that I still wasn't pleased with.

## Aim
A javascript project that can be easily added to an existing Google product (Doc, Sheets, Slide, Drawing, etc.). It needs to provide the user with a simple interface for authenticating and authorizing so that non-developers can use it. It needs to have a simplistic interface to allow non-developers to quickly integrate it into their Google Prod without being required to dig into Trello developer documentation.

##Expected Workflow
This is my (initial) expectation for the finished product (the end result might end up being a plugin).

1. User Creates New Google Product (Doc for example)
1. User Adds GAS-Trello Library
1.
